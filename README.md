This React app is a simple search engine that responds to your question both in the form of text and audio.

Using the wolfram alpha api I get the answer for users questions rendering them with react-router-dom, while at the same time sending that information to a second api (voice RSS) to provide an audio read-out at the same time.

### MVP:
* Use two api's to get answers and read answers.
* Render a text box on the second page with answer writing.
* Make the home text in the header a link back to the home page.

### Post MVP:
* Make the background image on the home page randomly shuffle between several genius each time the page is loaded.
* Add a button that when click provides the user with a quote from the person featured in the background.
